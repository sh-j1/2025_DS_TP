"""
This script merges two CSV datasets based on their common columns using pandas.
Preprocessing Steps:
- Loads two datasets: a mental health dataset and a stress level dataset, from specified file paths.
- Standardizes the column names of the stress level dataset by stripping whitespace, converting to lowercase, and replacing spaces with underscores to facilitate matching.
- Identifies common columns between the two datasets.
- If common columns exist, merges the datasets using the first common column as the key with an inner join.
- Saves the merged DataFrame to 'merged_by_common_column.csv'.
Dependencies:
- pandas
Notes/Assumptions:
- The script assumes that both input CSV files exist at the specified paths.
- Only the first common column found is used as the merge key.
- The merge is performed as an inner join, so only rows with matching values in the merge key will be included in the output.
- The script prints informative messages about the merge process and the result.
